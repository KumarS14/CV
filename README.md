## Sonjay Kumar

I am a computer student enthusiast who is interested in software engineering specifically In web development. I have a deep interest in the field of software engineering and enjoy creatively finding solutions to problems using programming. This interest grew throughout my  Level three foundation / extended diploma in computing and continues to develop the more I explore the subject and convert ideas into functioning programming.

While doing my diploma I learnt python and C # where I did assignments on them, and I had to a coding exam in C # sharp where I received a merit for the exam. Additionally, I had to do a assignment using C sharp where I had created a BMR calculator with a GUI using wpf. In my own spare time, I learnt html and some CSS through a html code camp YouTube video then I proceeded to create my own taco shop page using html. The last language I am familiar with is Ruby where I completed a 10-to-15-hour free code camp course.

Looking at the principles I am familiar with I have learnt object-oriented programming during my diploma where I had to code and do an assignment on OOP implementing one of the principles.

**Uxbridge College** (06/04/21 to 15/04/21)  
Work Experience - Asset Management

For my work experience, I volunteered for Uxbridge college to help with their computer systems in preparation for the next year. During this work experience I learned how to do: 
- Asset management 
- Removed old hardware and replaced it with new ones 
- Organized assets 
- Checked the suitability of assets 
- Participated with the college in group projects
## Skils
#### Communication
In my work experience I had to work with two people I never worked with before we were originally very shy and we were working independently but I took the initiative to introduce myself and communicate with them which resulted in us working together which made doing the tasks alot easier.

#### Resilience
during my work experience as a asset manager I was given tasks to do independently while being on a deadline . While doing the tasks independently I gained a tremendous amount of confidence as originally I had self doubts on what my capabilities were but now I know I can do anything .
 
#### Teamwork
While doing my work experience as a asset manager I had to work in a team of three where we had to image twenty pcs. At the start we were doing it independently but once we got to knew each other we worked together and by working together we made it alot easier to do and it was quicker to do as well

#### Learning
Doing a software development course at college I got to learn how to program in python and c-sharp and while I was struggling to learn those languages as I did not know how to program before by taking my own initiative I decided to revise it on my own and now im very proficient in programming.
 
#### Problem Solving
Often during work experience I had my managers be busy so when I was testing items I would have problems but rather then wasting time I took my own initiative looked up on google how to fix a electrical item and then I fixed it myself alot of times.
